/*
Oops! In this exercise, we have a variable binding that we've created on
line 7, and we're trying to use it on line 8, but we haven't given it a
value. We can't print out something that isn't there; try giving x a value!
This is an error that can cause bugs that's very easy to make in any
programming language -- thankfully the Rust compiler has caught this for us!
